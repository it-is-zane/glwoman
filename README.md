# glwoman
Intended to eventualy be a successor to
[GLman](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/glman/)
[GLman-docs](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/glman/Doc/glman.pdf)

## Reasons to move away from GLman
- glman is only intened to run on windows
- as I recall glman crashes quite a bit
- only supports glsl

## Goals
- Backwards compatable with GLman projects

## Ideas
- Builtin shader editor
